                <p>My name is Fatiu Ibrahim. I teach College Science on a part time basis. This is just a fancy way of saying that I specialize in Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry. I am also interested in Coding, Hence my application to TiideLab</p>
                <p>Science is COOL. I believe that the best foundation to a career in  science can only be laid at the secondary school level, provided that the Teacher teaches from first principles and rewards initiative and curiosity in the students</p>
